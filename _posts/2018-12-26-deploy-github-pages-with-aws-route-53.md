A small guide from registering a domain name with AWS, specifically Route 53, get it certified via ACM (also by AWS) and creating a github page for a static generating site. In this case I will go through how I created this blog/portfolio static page.

## Step 1
You will need to have registered for both [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) accounts.
Create an empty respository, usually in the format of username.github.io, otherwise anyname will do.
